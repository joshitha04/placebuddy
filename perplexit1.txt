Here’s an expert blueprint for your full multimodal emotion recognition repo setup. This includes links to best-in-class open-source implementations that precisely match your needs, plus a breakdown of which repos/scripts to use for each project module. All projects below are well-maintained, widely cited, and designed for robust research or deployment.

1. Audio Emotion Recognition - Pretrained Model
A. Vesper — SOTA for SER

Repo: github.com/HappyColor/Vesper

Features: Emotion-specific pretrained model; clear training/inference scripts; configurable and supports your own datasets; sensitive to subtle cues like shivers/tremors.

Setup: See repo README for installation, dataset config, and training/finetuning details.

Alternative

Wav2Vec2 SER Baseline: speechbrain/emotion-recognition-wav2vec2-IEMOCAP or Dpngtm/wav2vec2-emotion-recognition.

Handles 8-class emotion recognition with simple Huggingface/Torch API.

2. Audio Feature Extraction (Prosody, Shiver Detection, etc.)
Repo: audeering/opensmile

Features: Extracts jitter, shimmer, MFCC, prosody, HNR—essential for capturing vocal instability, shivers, etc.

Setup: Clone the repo, build or use prebuilt binaries, and run extraction via config files.

Helper Script for Batch Extraction:

OpenSMILE-to-csv

Python script to convert OpenSMILE output to usable CSV+frame index.

3. Audio Extraction from Video
Extract audio tracks from videos with one line of Python (using moviepy):

python
from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip
VideoFileClip("input_video.mp4").audio.write_audiofile("output_audio.wav")
Or use FFmpeg for batch processing:

bash
ffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 output_audio.wav
Batch support and automation: see detailed guides and scripts at [thepythoncode.com/article/extract-audio-from-video-in-python].

4. Multimodal Fusion (Deep Model, SOTA Implementations)
A. Self-Attention Fusion (Audiovisual)

Repo: katerynaCh/multimodal-emotion-recognition

Implements several fusion strategies with audio and video, transformer-based late/intermediate attention, and supports per-frame prediction—a great match for time-dependent outputs.

B. Large-Scale Multimodal Toolkit

Repo: declare-lab/multimodal-deep-learning

Multiple multimodal fusion models (Tensor Fusion, LMF, MISA, etc.), widely used and actively maintained.

C. State-of-the-Art Multimodal LLM for Emotion (Optional/Advanced)

Repo: Emotion-LLaMA

For large-scale, instruction-tuned, multimodal setups combining audio, video, and text—optional but bleeding edge.

Clone the repositories and follow each repo’s instructions for installing dependencies, training, and evaluation.

6. Full Pipeline Realization
Audio: Extract from video → openSMILE for prosody/shiver cues → feed into Vesper/Wav2Vec2.

Video: Recommended: expand with SOTA facial/body models (see MMER and fusion repos for examples).

Fusion: Use provided fusion modules (“late transformer,” attention models, etc.) to combine outputs, and produce a time-dependent emotion spectrum/series.

Final Output: Time-aligned, per-window or per-frame probability scores across all modalities.

These repositories and setup will let you immediately move from raw video input to highly accurate, time-indexed emotion recognition, fused across all modalities—ideal for assisting mental health professionals as you described.
